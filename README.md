## Coding Challenge try

Here is implemented the resolution of the exercise coding challenge of aerolab's company.

As ever `npm start` will do the magic, or create a local environment to view the app at `http://localhost:3000`

Following the style guide I've found that there was a filter by most recent, but API data of the products doesn't provide any date attribute, so I've omitted that filter.

All is implemented with `create-react-app` and deployed with `now/vercel` at `https://aerolab-coding-challenge-six.vercel.app`

Enjoy!
